/**
 * A base storage abstract class which is actually responsible for data persistence. This
 * abstract class implies all the usual responsibilities of a Store implementation,
 *
 * There are serval proposals for storage-partition model:
 *
 * 1. One storage engine for all stores
 *  1.1 One store uses one database, i.e. all partitions of the store will be in one database.
 *  1.2 One store uses multiple databases, i.e. one partition per database.
 * 2. Each store handled by one storage engine
 *  2.1 All partitions of the store will be handled in one database (current Voldemort implementation)
 *  2.2 One partition per database (Sudha suggests)
 * 3. Each partition handled by one storage engine (original proposal before todayâ€™s discussion, super high overhead)
 *
 * The point of having one storage engine(environment) or one database for one partition, is to simplify the complexity of rebalancing/partition migration/host swap.
 * The team agreed to take (2.2) as default storage-partition model for now, and run performance tests to see if it goes well.
 *
 *
 * TODO: This is just a stub code for now. I plan to populate the methods later when implementing the storage engines.
